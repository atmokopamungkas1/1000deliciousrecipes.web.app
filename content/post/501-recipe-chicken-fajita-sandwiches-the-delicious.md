Fajita chicken is typically made with lean chicken breasts meaning it is high in protein and low in fat. To make it even more nutritious, it&#39;s combined with peppers and onions and cooked on the grill which requires very little oil. As a result, fajita chicken is loaded with vitamins, nutrients, fiber, and, of course, flavor! Fajitas combine juicy chicken seasoned with Mexican spices (like chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, cumin, and oregano) and sweet sauteed peppers and onions.
