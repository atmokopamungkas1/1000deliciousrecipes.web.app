The sweet-tartness of dried cranberries pairs deliciously with the cheese, creamy avocado and balsamic vinegar. Get your greens on Lettuce — The darker or redder, the better — so think romaine and leaf lettuces (vitamin C, folic acid, potassium). Leafy greens — Jazz things up with spring mix, baby spinach and kale or arugula (beta-carotene, antioxidants). Pro tip: Steer clear of iceberg and other pale lettuces.
