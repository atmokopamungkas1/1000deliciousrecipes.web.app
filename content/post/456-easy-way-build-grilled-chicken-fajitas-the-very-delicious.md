##### Steps to make Grilled chicken fajitas:


1. Ready to serve and ENJOY!

Tender juicy chicken breasts, fresh crisp peppers, and sweet onions tossed in an easy homemade seasoning and piled high in tortillas. Trim any fat off the chicken breasts and slice into strips. Slice the jalapeno, onion, and bell pepper into strips (remove all seeds and pith). While the chicken is hanging out in the marinade, I like to mix a spicy sour cream. Fajita Cream: Pour marinade over chicken, stir to thoroughly coat each piece of chicken.
