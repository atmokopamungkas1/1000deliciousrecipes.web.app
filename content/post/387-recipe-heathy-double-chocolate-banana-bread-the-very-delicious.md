Hello everybody, it's John, welcome to my recipe site. Today, we're going to prepare a special dish, heathy double chocolate banana bread. It is one of my favorites. For mine, I will make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

For a healthy swap, I used white whole wheat flour for part of the flour in this recipe (the rest is all-purpose flour). The swap is imperceptible, and the whole wheat flour provides more protein and fiber. Banana adds delicious natural sweetness to the bread and gives it that signature, beloved flavor. Combine the flour, baking soda, salt, and cocoa.
