Bread Flour - Using bread flour gives the focaccia a chewy texture; you can substitute all-purpose flour without ruining the recipe, but your bread will be significantly lighter and missing that characteristic texture. Stir with a spatula or spoon. To turn your focaccia into a meal, simply spread a thin layer of fresh spinach over the dough and top it with minced garlic and an herb and oil mixture before putting it into the oven. Once again, a sprinkle of parmesan cheese just before the focaccia finished baking goes well with this focaccia meal but is not entirely necessary.
