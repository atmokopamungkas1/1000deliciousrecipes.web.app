Milanesa a la Napolitana--&#39;Neopolitan-Style&#39; Schnitzel Months ago, I wrote about how the iconic Milanesa got it&#39;s name--and while the dish was pilfered by an Austrian Count during a stay in Italy and adopted by the Austrians as Wiener Schnitzel, those in Spanish-speaking countries use the name that&#39;s a nod to the city it came from. Milanesa napolitana is a traditional Argentine dish originating from Buenos Aires. It consists of a milanesa steak that&#39;s breaded, fried, then topped with a slice of ham, tangy tomato sauce, and thick slices of mozzarella, which will melt under the broiler. It is typically served with french fries on the side.
