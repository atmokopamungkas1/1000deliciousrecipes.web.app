Hello everybody, hope you are having an amazing day today. Today, I'm gonna show you how to prepare a distinctive dish, true ragu. It is one of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I will make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Chop the onion, carrot and celery together, heat a small amount of extra virgin olive oil in the bottom of a pan and fry the chopped onion, celery and carrot until soft. Add the minced meat and opened sausage and allow to cook until the meat is quite dry. Unfortunately, the international version of Bolognese is very different to the traditional sauce eaten by the people born and raised in Emilia-Romagna, where it has been enjoyed on Sundays and at festivals for centuries. Unlike ragù alla Bolognese, Neapolitan ragù is started without a battuto (the combination of carrot, onion and celery at the start of many Italian dishes); includes copious amounts of tomato sauce; and uses whole cuts rather than chopped or ground meat.

True Ragu is one of the most favored of recent trending meals in the world. It's appreciated by millions every day. It's easy, it's fast, it tastes yummy. True Ragu is something which I have loved my whole life. They're fine and they look wonderful.
