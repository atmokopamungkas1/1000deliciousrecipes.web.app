Thanks to my friends at Just BARE Chicken for sponsoring this post. Place the chicken pieces in a gallon size zippered plastic storage bag and set aside. In a small mixing bowl whisk together the marinade ingredients through the pepper (reserve water and cornstarch for later). Measure out and transfer ⅔ cup of the marinade (about half) to a small container and refrigerate for later.
