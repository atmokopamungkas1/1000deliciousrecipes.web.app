Nana knows a thing or two about home cooking. This hearty meat sauce is inspired by the classic ragù alla bolognese, which is a thick, meaty sauce that is simmered for hours with milk, red wine, and a couple of tablespoons or so of tomato paste—a surprisingly small amount of tomato by North America standards. Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste - of course Wine - this is optional but if you have a bottle open, add a big glug or two of red or white wine. Alcohol amplifies and carries flavor, and even a little bit can add another Canned tomatoes - most of the time I use crushed tomatoes, preferably in the puree.
