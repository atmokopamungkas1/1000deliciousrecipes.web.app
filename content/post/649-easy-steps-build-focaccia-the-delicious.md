Soft and spongy inside it&#39;s generously coated with extra virgin olive oil and large coarse sea salt that creates the perfect crust. This is exactly how focaccia should look and taste: golden-brown all over, soft but chewy on the inside, and so delicious that it doesn&#39;t need any additions. There are a lot of great components to this recipe, but the magic is really in the saltwater brine, which is the key to this focaccia&#39;s perfect taste and texture. Yeast, warm water, and sugar help the bread rise and give it structure.
