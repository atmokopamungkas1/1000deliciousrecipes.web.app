If you&#39;re familiar with Mike&#39;s Hot Honey and are wanting that slight vinegar note that it&#39;s known for, adding a little hot sauce or apple cider vinegar is the way to go. We prefer to use a mildly spicy vinegary hot sauce (like Frank&#39;s) to boost the pretty red color without making the honey overwhelmingly spicy. Hot Subs - Cheese Steaks - Hot Sub Sandwiches - Jersey Mike&#39;s Hot Subs Grilled fresh every time, our hot subs and cheese steaks are sure to please. Step Six: Pour the sauce through a fine-mesh strainer or cheesecloth to strain the flakes and seeds from the honey.

Hot Subs - Cheese Steaks - Hot Sub Sandwiches - Jersey Mike&#39;s Hot Subs Grilled fresh every time, our hot subs and cheese steaks are sure to please. Step Six: Pour the sauce through a fine-mesh strainer or cheesecloth to strain the flakes and seeds from the honey. I have long known that chilies and honey are excellent partners. (I often include the combo of honey and hot sauce in my recipes, from stir-fries to dressings.) But honey with the heat smacked right into the sweetness? One taste, and I was hooked. The extra Hot has even more chili peppers for more heat.
