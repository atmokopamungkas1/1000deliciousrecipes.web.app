##### The ingredients needed to make Collagen Protein Banana Bread:

1. Prepare  over ripe bananas
1. Take  eggs (beat)
1. Prepare  melted butter (I use smart balance for dairy free version)
1. Get  vanilla

1. Prepare  salt
1. Take  brown sugar

Adding protein powder to desserts and baked goods is one of my favorite things to do. You need a mix of blanched almond flour and gluten free all purpose flour. If you are not gluten free, you can use regular all purpose flour, but still use the almond flour. I recommend butter (either dairy free or regular) or coconut oil.

##### Steps to make Collagen Protein Banana Bread:


1. Ready to serve and ENJOY!

If you are not gluten free, you can use regular all purpose flour, but still use the almond flour. I recommend butter (either dairy free or regular) or coconut oil. To avoid any coconut flavor, be sure to use refined coconut oil. Remember that your baking time may change depending on the size of your dish or pan. Take your bread out of the oven, let it cool, and pop it out.
