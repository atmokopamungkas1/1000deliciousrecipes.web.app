I wish we had done anything else since we were waiting in the little non-heated vestibule. In a city packed with great deep-dish spots, Gino&#39;s owes its longevity and immense popularity to longstanding attention to detail. We recommend staying on the higher end of this, especially if your pie has an abundance of toppings. You may be able to get away with a lower temperature if your pizza isn&#39;t loaded with ingredients, but higher is still better. Heat brocoli in steam pack per directions on package (if using regular brocoli thaw and squeeze out extra water).
