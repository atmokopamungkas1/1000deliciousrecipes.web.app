##### Steps to make Deep Dish Sausage And Pepperoni Pizza:


1. Ready to serve and ENJOY!

Press in bottom and up side of pan, folding edge under to form crust. Spoon hot sausage mixture over cheese. We recommend staying on the higher end of this, especially if your pie has an abundance of toppings. You may be able to get away with a lower temperature if your pizza isn&#39;t loaded with ingredients, but higher is still better. The dough is refrigerated for a second time so that the layers can be preserved, it may rise somewhat, and the butter can harden.
