Serve your Greek chicken salad on pita or in a pita pocket, on sandwich bread, with crackers as an appetizer, or over a bed of lettuce as a salad. If you have extra time you can begin marinating the chicken a few hours before cooking or you can start cooking right away. Once you got your seasoned chicken roast it on a sheet pan to keep things simple and quick. While the chicken is roasting I like to make a quick homemade tzatziki sauce. But store-bought easily works as well!
