Because if you want the cream a little lighter you can just add a few tablespoons of water. However, if using lighter cream, it&#39;s not as easy to thicken unless you add a heavier cream or a roux which just complicates this simple pasta. So double cream all the way! Savory mushroom sauce is rich, creamy, and loaded with mushroom flavor!
