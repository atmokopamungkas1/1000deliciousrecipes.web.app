This is a great party idea (photos coming soon). We had our first heat wave over the weekend. Quite simply, the salty and sour qualities of preserved lemon adds a sublime and intense citrus flavour to the hummus. Of course, they pair splendidly with fresh mint, which adds herbaceous freshness and a subtle speckle of colour throughout the hummus. This recipe is only eight ingredients (aside from the dippers!) including chickpeas, dark cocoa powder, coconut milk (or dairy/nondairy alternative of your choice), agave (or honey) mint extract, fresh mint, salt, and mini chocolate chips.
