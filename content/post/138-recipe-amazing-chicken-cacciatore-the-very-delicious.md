This is one of those recipes I found years ago in an old, tattered Italian cookbook. Vegetables &amp; Aromatics: onions, celery, bell peppers (I used ½ red bell pepper and ½ green bell pepper, but any combination will work), garlic. A combination of dry oregno with fresh thyme and parsley. You could make this with any cut of chicken.

A combination of dry oregno with fresh thyme and parsley. You could make this with any cut of chicken. However, the cut of meat you use will determine how flavorful the sauce turns out and how juicy your chicken is. We recommend dark meat over white meat for the best flavor and maximum juiciness. This recipe is the best because it&#39;s loaded with lots of vegetables and is a family favorite. —Barbara Roberts, Courtenay, British Columbia Jump to Recipe Chicken Cacciatore is a classic Italian dish that&#39;s made with chicken, bell peppers, onion, garlic, and tomatoes.
