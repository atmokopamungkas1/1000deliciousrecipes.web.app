Broccoli salad is a classic summer cookout dish, but the traditional recipe is loaded up with sugar, ample mayo, bacon, and cheese. My recipe is a fresher, healthier version - I nix the sugar, meat, and cheese altogether - and the result is a crisp, refreshing, tangy dish that&#39;ll be the star of your cookouts all summer long! Solution: a) give the salad time to marinate in the creamy lemon dressing which slightly tenderises the broccoli. Both the acid and the oil in the dressing helps here; and b) slicing the florets thickly rather than leaving them whole.

##### Instructions to make Broccoli Salad:


1. Ready to serve and ENJOY!

Solution: a) give the salad time to marinate in the creamy lemon dressing which slightly tenderises the broccoli. Both the acid and the oil in the dressing helps here; and b) slicing the florets thickly rather than leaving them whole. More surface area = better marinating effect to take the hard raw edge off the broccoli. For best taste, let it sit! While this easy broccoli salad can be served right away, I prefer to let it sit in the refrigerator for a few hours to let all of the flavors really meld together.
