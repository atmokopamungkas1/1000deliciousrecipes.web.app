Hello everybody, it's Jim, welcome to our recipe page. Today, I'm gonna show you how to make a distinctive dish, herbal focaccia. It is one of my favorites. For mine, I am going to make it a bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Focaccia bread is a flat oven-baked yeast bread that originated in Italy and is pronounced &#34;fuh-KA-cha.&#34; It is traditionally topped with fresh herbs, such as rosemary, and coarse salt, but it is a very versatile bread that can be altered to your liking. The homemade bread is chewy and soft in the center with a mega crisp exterior. We like it shared as an appetizer just as is; or at most, perhaps alongside a creamy goat cheese. Or a little longer if your bread machine doesn&#39;t have a pizza cycle.
