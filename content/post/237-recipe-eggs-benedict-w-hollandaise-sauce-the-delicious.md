Hey everyone, I hope you're having an amazing day today. Today, we're going to make a special dish, eggs benedict w/ hollandaise sauce. It is one of my favorites. This time, I will make it a bit unique. This will be really delicious.

To make the hollandaise sauce: In a blender, combine the egg yolks, lemon juice, mustard, cayenne, and salt and blend it briefly to combine. Bring the water to a boil and then reduce heat until it reaches a simmer. You should see small bubbles coming to the surface but not rolling. Add a little splash of vinegar to the water (this is optional, but it helps the egg white to stay together once it is in the water).

Eggs Benedict w/ Hollandaise Sauce is one of the most favored of current trending meals on earth. It's enjoyed by millions daily. It is simple, it is fast, it tastes yummy. They are nice and they look wonderful. Eggs Benedict w/ Hollandaise Sauce is something that I have loved my whole life.
