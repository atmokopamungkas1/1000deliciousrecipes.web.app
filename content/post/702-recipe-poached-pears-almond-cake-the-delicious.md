We don&#39;t want a dry cake. The addition of the poached pears changes this from a simple cake to something very special. Use Beurre Bosch if you can find them, they are great for poaching as they retain their shape well. Vegetarian &#34;This flourless upside-down cake, with a base of ginger-poached pears, is spicy, sweet and satisfying.
