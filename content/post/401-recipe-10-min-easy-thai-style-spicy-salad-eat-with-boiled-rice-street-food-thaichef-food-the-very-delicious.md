This is a review for thai restaurants in Silver Spring, MD: &#34;New favorite thai spot!! Love the option to add scallops specifically instead of just &#34;seafood&#34; to the fried rice. They wrote a cute message on the doordash bag. Got Thai fried rice with tofu and scallops, thai iced tea, and tom yum.
