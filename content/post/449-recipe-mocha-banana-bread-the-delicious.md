##### Instructions to make Mocha banana bread:


1. Ready to serve and ENJOY!

In a small bowl, mash the bananas with a fork. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt, stirring with a whisk or sift if the cocoa is. In a large bowl combine sugar and butter and beat with a mixer at medium speed until well creamed, for at least two. Like Mexican horchata, which Americans are more familiar with, horchata de chufa is made by soaking then blending the starchy rice (Mexico) or tigernut (España), and straining the liquid--which is sweetened and chilled before serving. Traditionally they use sugar, but I&#39;m a fan of sweetening it with a date or two.
