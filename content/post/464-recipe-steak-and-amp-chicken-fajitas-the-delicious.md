##### Steps to make Steak &amp; Chicken Fajitas:


1. Ready to serve and ENJOY!

Season: Sprinkle each side of the steak generously with salt and pepper, then immediately place in the skillet. Ribeye (aka Delmonico, Spencer, Entrecote) Either bone-in or boneless, a ribeye is essentially a thick slice of prime rib served as a steak. Lots of flavorful marbling with a very meaty flavor, the ribeye is a prime candidate for quick, high-heat cooking on the grill or skillet. Salt and Pepper Ribeye Steak: The key to this recipe is to salt. To begin, pat the steak dry with paper towels. (Any moisture on the exterior of the steak must first evaporate before the meat begins to brown.) Season the steaks generously on both sides with salt and pepper; the seasoning will stick to the surface and help create a delicious crust.
